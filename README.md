# Kometto

**Kometto** is a communication infrastructure for AI agents.  
It gives agents real-world identities (email + phone) via simple APIs, webhooks, and compliance-aware messaging relay.

## Status: MVP Development (v0.1)

🚧 Work-in-progress. Core goal:  
Enable agents to receive inbound emails and respond programmatically — with webhooks, rate limits, and deliverability guardrails.

## Goals
- Agent API with inbox address
- Email webhook relay (inbound)
- Agent reply API (outbound)
- AWS SES integration
